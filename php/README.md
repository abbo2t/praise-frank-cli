# PHP rewrite scaffold

This directory contains a minimal scaffold for rewriting `run_animation.py` in PHP.

Quick start

- Run the scaffold:

```bash
php php/index.php
```

Translation notes

- Review `run_animation.py` and port logic into `php/src/`.
- If the Python version uses third-party libs, identify PHP equivalents or implement replacements.
- Add `composer.json` and use PSR-4 autoloading for larger modules.
